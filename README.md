## The App idea
I had the idea of making a productivity App, where you can create different Tree structures to plan progressing in different skills, this is exactly
what you can do with this App. You can create Categories and create Trees in those Categories, where you can have multiple steps (simple checkbox or
counter) in a tree structure. The app displays all your trees in different ways. (You can search for a tree via searchbar or can scroll through them in
different sorted lists.

## Structure
It's a React App running JSON Server as a sort of mock backend. It's using redux for state managing and I'm using purely React hooks instead of classes, 
as i found them way better and wanted to learn React in it's most modern form right away.

## The finished product
This project is a school project (that's also why the text in the App is in german ()). In one year we learned react and we're then supposed to create a project
based on our newley obtained skills.

I have to say of the project itslef I am very proud of, it's not only my first big React Projects, it's one of my first big coding projects in general. 
Besides a lot of desperation, I also had a lot of fun and learned a lot building the App.

But because this is after all a school project with a deadline and I am the king of procrastionation there are a lot of ugly coding solutions that I had
to take in order to finish on time. I know that a lot of components could be way more reusable and some approchaes are striaght up bad.
But hey, after all I learned a lot, I like it, even though it's a bit ugly on some deeper levels. :)

There are a lot of features I would've liked to implemented like user authetication or creating a custom backend with nodejs. Probably not going to add those, 
as fixinf the Apps sometimes really horribly structure would be a lot of tedious work, but I'm look forward to implemend those and other ideas in future projects.
